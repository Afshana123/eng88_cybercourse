# Cryptography 

### Cryptography Essentials 
Encription - is a process which transform the original information into unrecognizable form
Decription - is a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer

### Cipers 
A cipher is an algrotihm that consistes of a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure when encripting and decrypting messages 
- Substitution cipher
- Transposition cipher

### Encription Classes 
Symmetric encription: that use the same key to encript and decript data 
- Block ciphers
- Stream ciphers
Assymmetric encription: that use different keys to encrypt and decrypt data

### Diffie-Hellman 
- An assymetric mathematical algortihm 
- Allows two computers to generate an identical shared secret without having communicated before 
- The new shared key is never actually exchanged between the sender and reciever

# Cryptography 

### Cryptography Essentials 
Encription - is a process which transform the original information into unrecognizable form
Decription - is a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer

### Cipers 
A cipher is an algrotihm that consistes of a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure when encripting and decrypting messages 
- Substitution cipher
- Transposition cipher

### Encription Classes 
Symmetric encription: that use the same key to encript and decript data 
- Block ciphers
- Stream ciphers
Assymmetric encription: that use different keys to encrypt and decrypt data

### Diffie-Hellman 
- An assymetric mathematical algortihm 
- Allows two computers to generate an identical shared secret without having communicated before 
- The new shared key is never actually exchanged between the sender and reciever 

### Hash Operation
Hashes are used to verify and ensure data integrity 
Based on a one-way mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute, but significantly harder to reverse 

- MD5 
- SHA-1
- SHA-2

### Password Salting 
- Salt is a unique value that can be added to the end of the password to create a different hash value 

## Public Key Infrastructure

### Using Digital Signatures 
Digital signatures are a mathematical tenchique used to provide authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation

Properties of digital signatures:
- Unalterable 
- Not resuable 
- Non-repudiated 

### Digital Signature Standards 
There are three Digital Signature Standard algorithms that are used for generating and verifying digital signatures:
- Digital Signature Algorithm
- Rivest-Shamir Adelman Algorithm
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

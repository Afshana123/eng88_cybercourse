# Introduction

### Nist
The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks 

### CNSS 
- Prevention of damage
- Protection of and the restoration of computers, electronic communication systems, electronic communications services, wire communication and electronic communication
- Including information contained in these ^
- To ensure it availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation

### Cybersecurity Cube 
A model framework for establishing and evaluating information security (information assurance) programs.

Depicted as a 3D Rubik's cube-like grid.

1. Desired goals
2. Data States 
3. Safeguards

### Desired goals 

1. Confidentiality 
- Unauthorised access is prevented
3. Integrity 
- Data should not be modified 
5. Availability 
- Access should not be unavailable 

### Data States 
1. Storage 
- Data at Rest (DAR) in an information system, such as that stored in memory or on a magnetic tape or disk.
3. Transmission
- Transferring data between information systems - also known as Data in Transit (DIT)
5. Processing 
- performing operations on daa in order to achieve a desired objective

### Safeguards 
1. Policy and practices 
- administrative controls, also referred to as operations
3. Human factors
- also referred to as personnel
5. Technology
- software and hardware based solutions

### Cybersecurity essential terms 
Asset: an asset is something that needs to be protected e.g data, device
Vulnerability: a weakness or gap in protection efforts
Exploit: the way hackers leverage vulnerabilties 
Threat: what we are trying protect against
Risk: intersection of asssets, threats and vulnerabilities 

#### Causes of Vulnerabilities 
- Design and Development Errors
- System Configuration Problems
- Human Error
- Connectivity
- Complexity
- Passwords
- User Input
- Management
- Lack of Staff training
- Communication

### Cyber Attacks 
1. Un-targeted
2. Targeted 

### Cyber Threat Actors #
1. Nation-states
2. Cybercriminals
3. Advanced Persistent Threats 
4. Hacktivists, terrorist groups, and thrill-seekers 
5. Insider threats
6. Natrual disasters
7. Accidential actions of authorised users 

### Cyber Threats 
- Malware: is software that does malicious tasks on a device or network
- Spyware: is a form of malware that hides on a device providing real-time information
- Phishing attacks: is when a cybercriminal attempts to lure individuals into providing senstive data 
- Distributed denial of service attacks: aim to disrupt a computer network by floording the networking with superfluous requests 
- Randsomeware: is a type of maware that denies access to a computer system or data unless a ransom is paid
- Zero-day exploits: is a flaw in software, hardware or firmware that is unknown to the party or parties responsiblie for patching the flaw
- Advanced persistent threats: is when an unauthorised user gains access to a system or network that remains there without being detected for an extended period ot time

## What are the 3 main computer components?
- Hardware 
- Software that runs on the hardware 
- Humanware 

The problem on the security side of things was that the humanware was ignore which is the user itself. 

For example: In Las Vegas, the Casino was hacked and Casino's have high security levels. They later found out that the teachnician bought a thermostat which had a bug in it and this managed to infiltrate the entire system.

Computers are not just laptops but it could be an Arudino, your car system, a game console or in the case above evene a thermostata. 

## Hardware 
contains:
- Motherboard - which is a circuit board that connects everything together
- CPU

    - Intel
    - AMD
    - ARM
    - Videa

  - BIOS/UEFA allows you to find out what storage you have on the computer. However, BIOS was limited to 2T and it was not secure. 
    
  - UEFA has a secure boot which checks for validity and security
    
- Audio/USB Ports/Hardrives

For example, in mining, they use GPU to mine cryptocurrency.

Network cards:

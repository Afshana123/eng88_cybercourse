### Biometric Authentication

Key advantages:
- Can be easily compared to authorised features saved in a database
- Can control physical access when installed on entrances and doors
- Can be added into multi-factor authentication process

common methods:
- Facial recognition
- Fingerprint scanner
- Voice identification
